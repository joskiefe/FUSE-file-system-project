Joshua Kiefer:  During our saturday meeting i worked with Andrew to create a mount point for our fuse file system. 
One sources i used was https://github.com/xolox/dedupfs as an example.
Also assisted John and David with numpy library usage of .diff operation that will determine length of intervals.
In addition collaborated with clearing spacing and formatting issues of timestamp files. 
All extraneous new lines and none float variables were cleaned up. Assisted David and John with the testing of our mountpoint.
Initially our results lead to the creation of a mount point directory that had unknown permissions values and unreadable/writable
behaviour, more testing and modifications are needed .

John Hutchins:  Worked with David on the FUSE system, we got code written to grab and remove timestamps from file without disturbing
other timestamps.  Also got a function set up that would clean out the timestamp file, specifically it removes extra spaces and lines
with multiple timestamps.  We also got an RNG function set up using the timestamps converted into random numbers as a seed.  
 
Andrew Stone:We met as a group for most of the afternoon and evening last Saturday.  I worked on and wrote a version of the getattr
function.  I also worked with Josh on seeking information about how to get the filesystem mounted, and I was able to locate the
article linked below that provided some good insight on the subject.  I also provided general support and backup to John and David
in the form of looking up various aspects of python that they needed clarification on, or any other subject that needed clarification.

David Eling: Mainly worked on the fuse ground work and such at the start. Then worked on the actual functions and uses
of the system with John during our meeting, details above. Worked later on trying to figure out how to get it to actually write and
read, cant seem to get it to work. All attempts failed. Articles to read or check out
